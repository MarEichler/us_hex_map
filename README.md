# US Hex Map (States and Territories)

US Hex Map with just States: [r-graph-gallery.com/hexbin-map](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/hexbin-map)


I've copied the coordinates from the NPR Graphics team: [github.com/nprapps/dailygraphics-templates/blob/master/state_grid_map/index.html](https://github.com/nprapps/dailygraphics-templates/blob/master/state_grid_map/index.html). The y values have been reversed so that the plot is not upside down.
